    "**Exception:-** An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\n",

For example, when we divide any number by zero then the ZeroDivisionError exception is raised, or when we import a module that does not exist then ImportError is raised."
