This can occur when two or more threads hold resources that the other thread needs to continue execution, resulting in a deadlock. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, as they can involve complex interactions between threads and shared resources.\n",

Race conditions can occur when two or more threads access shared resources or modify shared data in an uncoordinated manner. This can lead to incorrect behavior or crashes, as the threads may overwrite each other's changes or make incorrect assumptions about the state of shared resources."
