    "Ans-1) Objects are the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming. An object contains some properties and methods. We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs. This is the general procedure to implement abstraction in OOPS."

Before discussing what abstract classes are, let us have a brief introduction of inheritance. Inheritance in OOP is a way through which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class."
