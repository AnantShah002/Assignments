    " 1. **Descriptive Statistics:-** Descriptive statistics involves the collection, analysis, and presentation of data to summarize and describe characteristics of a dataset. It is used to provide a concise and meaningful summary of data through measures such as central tendency, variability, and shape. Descriptive statistics is generally used when data is available for the entire population of interest, or when a sample is used to estimate population parameters.\n",
    "* **Example of descriptive statistics:-** A researcher collects data on the heights of 100 students in a school. The researcher uses descriptive statistics to summarize the data by calculating the mean height, standard deviation, and creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics:-** Inferential statistics involves making predictions or generalizations about a population based on data from a sample. It is used to draw conclusions or test hypotheses about the population using the sample data. Inferential statistics is generally used when data is not available for the entire population, and a sample is used to make inferences about the population.\n",
    "* **Example of inferential statistics:-** A company wants to determine whether a new product will be successful among its target market. The company collects a sample of data from a group of customers who have purchased the product and uses inferential statistics to determine whether the data supports the conclusion that the product will be successful among the entire target market. The company may use techniques such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, or regression analysis to draw conclusions about the population."

    "Understanding the level of measurement is important when analyzing data because it determines the type of statistical analyses that can be performed on the data, as well as the appropriate way to interpret the results. Different types of statistical analysis are suited for different levels of measurement, and using an inappropriate analysis can result in inaccurate conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is nominal, it is inappropriate to perform calculations such as mean or standard deviation, as these statistics are not meaningful for categorical data. Instead, appropriate measures for nominal data include frequency counts and percentages. If a variable is ordinal, it is appropriate to use measures such as median or mode, but not mean, as the ranking of the values does not necessarily correspond to equal intervals. If a variable is interval or ratio, all three measures (mean, median, and mode) can be used, as well as measures such as standard deviation and correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate the importance of understanding the level of measurement is the analysis of income data. If income is measured as a nominal variable with categories such as \"less than 20,000\", \"20,000 to 40,000\", and \"more than 40,000\", it would be inappropriate to calculate the mean income, as the categories do not represent equal intervals. Instead, appropriate measures would include the frequency counts and percentages of individuals in each income category. If income is measured as a ratio variable in dollars, the mean income can be calculated and compared across different groups or time periods, and statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA can be used to determine whether there are significant differences in income between groups."

The median temperature would be represented by a line inside the box. This would allow for easy comparison of temperature ranges across different months or years, and also identify any unusually high or low temperatures as outliers."
