    "### Q1) What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "### Ans) **Database:-** The Database is an essential part of our life. As we encounter several activities that involve our interaction with databases, for example in the bank, in the railway station, in school, in a grocery store, etc. These are the instances where we need to store a large amount of data in one place and fetch these data easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:-** statistics it is raw and unprocessed . ex- name , class , marks etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **information:-** = when data is processed . ” record is also information “. example – pass or fail table etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database:-** an organized collection of data and information or interrelated data collected at one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL:-** RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS). These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema. These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.\tThese databases are best suited for complex queries. In this data base we get Vertically Scalable. This database Follows ACID property. SQL Databases Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NoSQL:-** Non-relational or distributed database system. They have dynamic schema. These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage. These databases are not so good for complex queries. In this data base we get Horizontally scalable. This database Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance). NoSQL Database Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc"

The purpose of the DQL Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is a component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it. It includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform operations with it. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a further temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program a front-end.\n",

    "### Ans)\n",
    "The SQL order of execution defines the order in which the clauses of a query are evaluated. Some of the most common query challenges people run into could be easily avoided with a clearer understanding of the SQL order of execution, sometimes called the SQL order of operations. Understanding SQL query order can help you diagnose why a query won’t run, and even more frequently will help you optimize your queries to run faster.\n",
